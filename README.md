# Babbitt Logseq Demo

This repository contains demo data and scripts intended to be used with [Logseq](https://github.com/logseq/logseq), an open-source note-taking tool. This project shows how to use Logseq to structure personal notes and track important information over time.

The demo data takes the perspective of George Babbitt, the protagonist of Sinclair Lewis's 1922 novel *Babbitt*. I chose an accessible story in the public domain so that others could understand and build on these notes. The full text of Babbitt is available for free from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1156).
