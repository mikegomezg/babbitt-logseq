- [[work]] - tenement visit, got Henry a discount, Stan Graff bonus
  collapsed:: true
	- drove a prospect out to the four-flat tenement in Linton
		- he admired the new lighter - knew it was a good idea
		- we talked technology on the way - modern fella
		- inspected the property - he'll buy soon enough
	- picked up [[Henry Thompson]]
		- visited Zenith Foundry Company
			- talked to secretary about the fence for [[Linden Lane Cemetery]]
		- visited Zeeco Motor Company
			- talked to [[NoÃ«l Ryland]], fellow Booster - a bit too modern for me with his fancy footwear
			- got Henry a discount though he didn't approve - thinks I'm a moocher for it
			- Henry doesn't see the value of partnerships - thinks he can do it all himself
	- [[Stanley Graff]] asked for a bonus - had to put him in his place but felt bad after
		- Graff is getting married and wants to earn more
		- thinks he deserves it if he closes [[Heiler]]
		- had to push back:
			- our leads and properties give him a big leg up
			- it'd be unfair to the rest of the staff
			- there are plenty of others who'd like his job
		- he took it hard, told everyone in the office I said no
		- felt their disapproval when I left - hate to end the day like that
- [[family]] - new car, college for Ted, my marriage
  collapsed:: true
	- brought up buying a new car at dinner
		- whole family wants a closed car even though its more expensive - wanna look like millionaires
		- told them I'm not buying it this year
	- [[Verona]] ran off immediately after dinner
	- [[Ted]] showed me ads for correspondence courses
		- thinks he doesn't need to go to college, can just study something practical
		- I told him having a BA makes a big difference - clients take you seriously, makes you a gentleman
		- I'd hate to see him lose what I have - he seemed to understand
		- didn't realize correspondence courses were such a big industry - impressive #vision
	- [[Myra]] asked me to talk to Ted about girls, got me thinking about how we met
		- she's [[Paul Riesling]]'s second cousin
		- listened to all my hopes and dreams after college
		- one night she just declares that we're engaged and I didn't have the heart to break it off
		- she's been a good, loyal wife
		- just as sorry as me when things didn't pan out and I stuck to real-estate
