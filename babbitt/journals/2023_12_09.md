			- ideas

				- key differences between profession and mere trade
					- public service
					- trained skill
			- process
				- [[Howard Littlefield]] - got me some good sales stats
				- [[T. Cholmodeley Frink]] - asked him about some phrasings, but came up with a lot of it myself - writing not as hard as it seems!
				- one day stopped worrying about style and just wrote what I thought - [[Myra]] liked it
				- gave it to [[Ira Runyon]] at *Advocate-Times*
		- delivery - nervous before, but speech well-received
			- met delegates from all over the state aftewards, they all knew my name - appreciated me boosting the Profession
			- made it into the *Advocate* the next morning - that'll show them back in Zenith!
		- appointed to committee on Torrens Titles
			- simplify land transactions, clearly show ownership
	- Sparta picked for the convention next year but Zenith put up a fight
		- our delegation ran a circus parade right through the meeting - I was a clown, Whitby worse a bearskin
		- Sparta Chamber of Commerce offered $8,000 for hosting, stole the bid

  collapsed:: true
	- [[Lucile McKelvey]] - saw her at Union Station, looked right through me
		- she must have been heading to Europe
		- I decided to have my clothes pressed on the train - felt good to have a private compartment and attendant
	- on the final night, went out with [[W.A. Rogers]], [[Elbert Wing]]
		- tea at the Catalpa Inn became cocktails in Sassburger's room - Pioneer fella, wife is quite the mixologist
		- Rogers, Wing and I went back to our room, had dinner at the hotel, caught a show and then stayed out in Monarch
		- felt crumby the next morning, like college
- [[family]] - [[Myra]] couldn't make conference, sent [[Tinka]] a postcard
