- [[social]] - gin from Healy, dinner party
  collapsed:: true
	- bought gin from Healy Hanson - friend of [[Jake Offutt]]
		- $12 a quart - pricy but proud to provide it at dinner
		- made the cocktails without a shaker - wouldn't want to come off as a Drinker
	- party guests - [[Howard Littlefield]], [[Vergil Gunch]], [[Eddie Swanson]], [[Orville Jones]], [[T. Cholmodeley Frink]] and their wives
		- prohibition - Frink and Verg said the magic words, "parking on the wrong side of the street"
			- we emptied the cocktail pitcher talking about prohibition
			- Littlefield said they ought to have licensed the drinkers - save the workmen from themselves but preserve our freedom
		- small-town folk - Frink said he'd seen a lot of them lately on his lecture tour
			- we all agreed they make poor conversation, disagreed about how much is their fault

		- [[marketing]] - Frink read his Zeeco car ad
			- said the ad men for Prince Albert Tobacco are the real American literary geniuses
		- seance - Frink summoned Dante
			- Frink was pretty immersed in this spiritualism stuff - makes you wonder if he's a socialist
			- Verg cracked jokes, I wish I had read Dante
		- overall everyone had fun, drinks certainly loosened us up
