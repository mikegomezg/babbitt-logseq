- [[social]] - ugly fight with Zilla, [[Paul Riesling]] trip to Maine
  collapsed:: true
	- Myra and I visited [[Zilla Riesling]] and Paul
		- wanted Zilla's OK to let Paul go up early with me
		- Zilla called Paul a coward for not sticking up for her
		- Paul said he's been cheating on her
		- I defended Paul, told Zilla what they say her behind her back
		- she groveled in response and I forgave her - whole thing was melodramatic
		- Myra was disgusted by the whole scene, told me I was nasty - she's right, maybe work getting to me
		- but still glad I stood up for Paul
	- bought tackle at Sporting Goods Mart
		- [[Willis Ijams]] sold us the dry flies -  apparently dry more sporting than wet
	- met a few good fellows on the New York Express up to Maine
		- Paul came off like a highbrow calling a steel plant "picturesque", got annoyed when I tried to cover for him
		- talked the usual stuff until one of the guys started telling stories, ended up chatting till 2 AM
