- [[social]] - ugly fight with Zilla, [[Paul Riesling]] trip to Maine
  collapsed:: true
	- Myra and I visited Paul and [[Zilla Riesling]]
		- wanted Zilla's OK to let Paul go up early with me
		- Zilla called Paul a coward for not sticking up for her
		- Paul said he's been cheating on her
		- I defended Paul, told Zilla what they say her behind her back
		- she groveled in response and I forgave her - whole thing was melodramatic
		- Myra was disgusted by the whole scene, told me I was nasty - she's right, maybe work getting to me
		- but still glad I stood up for Paul
	- bought tackle at Sporting Goods Mart
		- [[Willis Ijams]] fellow Booster and a good salesman, said to buy the dry flies - more sporting
	- met some good fellows in the smoking car of the New York Express up to Maine
		- talked the usual stuff until one of the guys started telling stories - ended up chatting till 2 AM
		- Paul came off a highbrow - didn't talk much, called a steel plant "picturesque", then got annoyed when I tried to cover for him
