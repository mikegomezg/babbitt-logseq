- [[health]] - need to walk more, bought lighter, big lunch at the club
  collapsed:: true
	- exercise - gonna start walking every noon to the club, was too late this time
	- smoking - bought an electric cigar-lighter
		- been on my mind for weeks
		- got to thinking about expenses and just sprang for it all of a sudden
		- trying to quit but I suppose it could help sales - give me some refinement
	- eating - bigger lunch with Paul than I planned
		- ordered apple pie, fries
- [[social]] - Zenith Athletic Club, planned Maine trip with Paul
  collapsed:: true
	- saw the Roughnecks when I came in - [[Vergil Gunch]], Finkelstein, Pumphrey
		- joshed with Verg about poker last night
		- that's where all the restlessness today came from
		- we traded swipes at each other's underhand dealings
		- saw them at lunch too but wanted to sit apart with Paul, even though privacy is frowned upon here
	- [[Paul Riesling]] - fighting with his wife, in worse shape than me, we planned a Maine trip
		- I brought up the restlessness I've been feeling today
		- he's even worse - sick of roofing, wishes he could just play his fiddle in peace
		- doesn't get along with Zilla - she's bad-tempered, but he won't divorce her
		- talks desperate but never does anything - says it's habit
		- he proposed going up to Maine for a few days before the families get there
		- sounds good to me - I'll make up some deal in NY that will fall through, give us the perfect excuse to go early
