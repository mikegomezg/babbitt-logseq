- [[health]] - need to walk more, bought lighter, big lunch at the club
  collapsed:: true
	- exercise - gonna start walking every noon to the club, was too late this time
	- smoking - bought an electric cigar-lighter
		- on my mind for weeks
		- got to thinking about expenses and just sprang for it
		- trying to quit but I suppose it could help sales - give me some refinement
	- eating - bigger lunch with Paul than I planned
		- ordered apple pie, fries
- [[social]] - Zenith Athletic Club, planned trip with Paul
  collapsed:: true
	- Roughnecks - [[Vergil Gunch]], Finkelstein, Pumphrey
		- joshed with Verg about the night before
		- that's where all the restlessness came from
		- traded swipes at our dealings
		- saw em at lunch too but wanted to sit apart with Paul
		- can't do that too often
	- [[Paul Riesling]] - fighting with his wife, worse shape than me, we planned a Maine trip
		- I brought up the restlessness
		- he's even worse - sick of roofing, wishes he were a fiddler
		- doesn't get along with Zilla - she's bad-tempered but he won't divorce
		- talks desperate, but he never does anything - says it's habit
		- he proposed going up to Maine for a few days before the families
		- sounded good to me - I'll make up some deal in NY that will fall through, give us the perfect excuse
