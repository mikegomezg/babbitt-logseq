- [[family]] - Verona and Ken, Ted and Eunice, visits with Myra's parents and my family
  collapsed:: true
	- [[Verona]] still seeing [[Kenneth Escott]]
		- she says they're just friends - they spend an awful lot of time together
		- odd how quiet they are - just stay in every night and talk, or if they do go out its to some silly lecture
		- he's a good kid though
	- concerned about [[Ted]] and [[Eunice Littlefield]]
		- she wants to be an actress, smokes
		- all Ted cares about is spending time with her and cars - bought him a motorcycle
		- hosted [[Ted]]'s senior class party, tift with [[Howard Littlefield]]
			- kids were drinking in their cars - [[Myra]] told me not to be too stern, wouldn't want Ted to get left out
			- caught Ted dancing too close with Eunice
			- Howard took her home, said she wasn't allowed over here
			- things have been cool between us for months, we'll talk politics but not family
	- [[Tinka]] wants to go to the movies 3 times a week
	- [[Myra]] and I visit [[Henry Thompson]] and his wife every other Sunday at the Hotel Hatton
		- uninspired dinners, then violin in the lounge - painful
	- [[mother]], Martin and his with and baby came to visit from Catawba
		- mother talked about father and his uncompromising political attitude, told some embarrassing childhood stories about me in front of Verona and Ted
		- Martin looked at us like millionaires - how much did we pay for this or that - no tact
- [[mind]] - family gets me feeling restless
  collapsed:: true
	- tired of supporting all of them - thankless job
	- it felt good to be sick and have an excuse to be grouchy
	- life feels so mechanical to me now - work, religion, social events - everything just a waste of time
	- wish I were out in nature without a care in the world
